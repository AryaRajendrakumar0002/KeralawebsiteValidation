      <h4 style="text-align:center;"><b>Alappuzha</b></h4>
      <p><b>Alappuzha (or Alleppey) is a city on the Laccadive Sea in the southern Indian state of Kerala. It's best known for houseboat cruises along the rustic Kerala backwaters, a network of tranquil canals and lagoons. Alappuzha Beach is the site of the 19th-century Alappuzha Lighthouse. The city's Mullakkal Temple features a traditional design. Punnamada Lake's snake boat races are a well-known annual event. </b></p>
      <p><b>Places to visit in Alleppey: Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary, Vembanad Lake, Mannarasala Temple, Ambalapuzha Temple, St. Andrew's Forane Church, Pathiramanal, Pandavan Rock, Edathua Church, etc.

        There is a diversity among the many places to visit in Alleppey, from the rewarding sight of the sea to the wriggling inlets of backwaters and jungle streams- No wonder Alleppey was called the “Venice of the east” by Lord Curzon. The concept of houseboats which is locally called Kettuvallam in Malayalam is a primitive practice in Kerala. 
        
        Located around 53 kilometers from Cochin, the town is celebrated for its backwaters which connect Cochin and Kumarakom to the North. Besides backwaters and the sea, Alleppey is also famous for its ageless temples, serpentine canals draining into the ocean, colorful lagoons, rice paddies, and a 150-year old lighthouse.  While you are soaking up the laid-back coastal bliss, do try to visit the famous Andhakaranazhi Beach- the beauty gets amplified during sunset hours. 
        
        The floating ground to the crowd-pulling houseboats is none other than the longest lake in India- Vembanad lake. The tour of Vembanad lake is mostly coupled with Pallippuram island which is a picturesque petite land in the middle of the lake. Alleppey is just more than backwaters and the beaches, it has a history that is worth learning about. A trip to this coastal paradise is total bliss.</b></p>
